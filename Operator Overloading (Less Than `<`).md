🐍 Python OOP: Operator Overloading (Less Than <)
🎯 AIM
To write a Python program that demonstrates operator overloading by overloading the less than (<) operator using a custom class.

🧠 ALGORITHM
Step1 :create class A and def   init  
Step2: def  it 
with a condition if self.a < o.a 
Step 3: call the function and execute the program. 
💻 Program
```
class A : 
def  init (self,a): 
self.a=a 
def  lt (self,o): 
if self.a < o.a : 
return "ob1 is less than ob2" 
else: 
return "ob2 is less than ob1" 
ob1 = A(2) 
ob2 = A(3) 
print(ob1<ob2)
```
Output
